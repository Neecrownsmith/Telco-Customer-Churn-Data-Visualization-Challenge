# Telco Customer Churn Data Visualization Challenge

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and analysis for the June Data Visualization Challenge - Telco Customer Churn. The challenge involved addressing the problem of massive customer loss experienced by a telecommunication company, Telco. As a Data Analyst, I have performed a comprehensive analysis of the Telco customer churn data to gain insights into the factors influencing customer churn and to propose data-driven strategies to improve customer retention.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis can be found in the "WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv" file. It contains information about Telco's customers, including demographics, services utilized, contract details, and churn status.

## Analysis and Findings
I have conducted an in-depth analysis of the data, exploring various customer segments and their churn behavior. Here are the key findings from the analysis:

1. **Price Sensitivity**: Customer churn is majorly influenced by price concerns. The cost of services offered by Telco plays a significant role in customer decisions to stay or leave.

2. **Service Utilization**: Customers using multiple services (phone and internet) are more likely to be affected by price changes, leading to higher churn rates.

3. **Dependents and Partners**: Customers with partners or dependents are less likely to churn since the Telco service is essential for their communication needs.

4. **Senior Citizens vs. Non-Senior Citizens**: Senior citizens have a higher churn rate compared to their total number, but non-senior citizens contribute more to the overall churn due to their larger share of the customer base.

5. **Internet Service and Add-ons**: Customers might not fully appreciate the value of add-ons like online security, backup, and device protection, leading to higher churn rates.

6. **Electronic Check Payment Method**: Issues with the electronic check payment method might be affecting customer satisfaction and contributing to churn.

7. **Long-Term Contracts**: Customers on short-term contracts are more likely to churn, necessitating strategies to encourage long-term contracts.

8. **DSL Internet Service**: Customers using Fiber Optic Internet Service might be more prone to churn due to its higher cost, which could be mitigated by suggesting DSL internet service.

9. **Paperless Billing**: Problems with paperless billing might lead to unnecessary charges or confusion among customers, impacting churn rates.

## Analysis and Visualization Code
I have created a report using Python and matplotlib to visualize the key insights and recommendations. The dashboard provides a clear overview of customer churn statistics, comparisons between different customer segments, and proposed solutions to address the customer loss issue effectively.

The code to the dashboard can be found in the "Telco Report.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook

The code for loading and preprocessing the dataset and performing the analysis can be found in the "Telco Data Analysis.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook.
